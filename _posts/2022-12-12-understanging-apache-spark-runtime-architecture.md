Spark is a popular distributed computing platform that is used for processing large amounts of data. It has a runtime architecture that is based on the concept of distributed computing, where data is divided into smaller chunks and distributed across a cluster of machines for parallel processing. This allows Spark to quickly and easily process large amounts of data in parallel, enabling efficient and scalable distributed computing. We will see the main components of the Spark runtime architecture and how they work together to enable distributed computing with Spark.

## Main components of the Spark architecture

The main components of the Spark runtime architecture are the **driver** and the **executors**. The driver is the main program that runs on the **master node** of the cluster and is responsible for coordinating the execution of the parallel operations on the data. The executors are worker processes that run on the **slave nodes** of the cluster and are responsible for executing the tasks assigned to them by the driver.

In addition to the driver and executors, the Spark runtime architecture also includes a number of other components, such as the **cluster manager**, which is responsible for managing the allocation of resources across the cluster, and the scheduling algorithm, which is used to determine how tasks are assigned to executors. These components work together to enable efficient and scalable distributed computing with Spark.

### Driver

For Spark to be able to process large amounts of data in parallel, it needs to be able to divide the data into smaller chunks and distribute them across a cluster of machines. The driver is the main program that runs on the master node of the cluster and is responsible for coordinating the execution of the parallel operations on the data. The driver is responsible for dividing the data into smaller chunks and distributing them across the cluster, and for coordinating the execution of the parallel operations on the data. The driver is also responsible for monitoring the health of the cluster, and for restarting failed executors.

### Executors

In Spark, the executors are worker processes that run on the slave nodes of the cluster and are responsible for executing the tasks assigned to them by the driver. The executors are responsible for executing the tasks assigned to them by the driver, and for reporting the results of the tasks back to the driver. The executors are also responsible for monitoring the health of the cluster, and for restarting failed executors.

### Cluster manager

Cluster managers are responsible for managing the allocation of resources across the cluster. They are responsible for allocating resources to the executors, and for launching new executors when the load of the cluster increases. Cluster managers are also responsible for monitoring the health of the cluster, and for restarting failed executors.

### Scheduling algorithm

The scheduling algorithm is used to determine how tasks are assigned to executors. It is responsible for deciding which tasks should be assigned to which executors, and how many tasks should be assigned to each executor. The scheduling algorithm is also responsible for deciding when to launch new executors to handle the load of the cluster.

## Tasks and stages

The driver creates the SparkContext object, which is used to create the DAGScheduler object.

DAG or Directed Acyclic Graph is a data structure that is used to represent the dependencies between the tasks that are executed by the executors.

The DAGScheduler is responsible for creating the DAG and scheduling the tasks. DAGScheduler is also responsible for monitoring the health of the cluster, and for restarting failed executors. **Stages** are groups of tasks that are executed by the executors.

## RDDs and partitions

RDD or Resilient Distributed Dataset is a data structure that is used to represent the data that is processed by the executors. RDDs are immutable, which means that they cannot be modified once they are created. RDDs are also fault-tolerant, which means that they can be recovered from failures.

## Transformations and actions

Transformations are operations that are applied to the data to create a new RDD. Transformations are lazy, which means that they are not executed immediately. Instead, they are added to the DAG and scheduled for execution by the DAGScheduler.
